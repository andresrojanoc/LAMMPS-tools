#C++ Scripts to perfom an additional type of Coulomb potential in LAMMPS
#This new potential allows the computation of the Coulomb interaction using a smooth truncation

smooth: folder with the files to copy/replace in the LAMMPS' src

#Ussage:

copy the content of the smooth folder in the LAMMPS src
compile LAMMPS
use coul/smooth with your desired cutoff radius

Note:
This potential corresponds to that explained in Walther et al. (2001) J. Phys. Chem. B
